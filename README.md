# BreakfastCafe
My online __ü•ê__ breakfast cafe is a website where guests can find out about the place before visiting.
### Description
The website is responsive, allowing you to reserve a table and leave comments from any device.

Users can reserve a table using the modal window on the logged in page. They have to choose the number of guests, location, date and time of reservation. After that, visitors should click the "Reserve" button and close the window.

Information about the reservation will appear on the admin page.

Users can add comments that will remain on the page even after closing.

But if you don't like the comment, you can easily delete it by pressing the "close" button
